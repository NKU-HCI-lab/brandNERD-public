The cool thing about my Nuna PIPA I own is that it can be used without a base, making it super convenient for me! When traveling, I pack my travel stroller in an Uppababy minu travel bag for extra padding. Bugaboo does sell one for the butterfly but it just didn’t look very protective. It usually doubles as my carry-on and fits in the overhead bin easily. I also have an Uppababy Mesa travel bag for the car seat in case I need to gate check any baby gear. And for hands free convenience, I’ll be using my wildbird aerial baby carrier to stay available for my toddler if he needs help!
