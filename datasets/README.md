## 00 - Original dataset

This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of unique raw brand names. These names were sourced from publicly accessible websites using automated web scraping techniques. The collected names represent surface-level identifiers for brands as they appear across various online platforms.

To ensure data quality, a cleaning process was applied after the initial collection. This included the removal of syntactically invalid entries, such as brand names made up exclusively of numerical characters.

The dataset is organized by product count, with brands appearing in descending order of their occurrence on the platform. This means that brands associated with the highest number of products are listed first, offering insights into brand prominence based on platform representation.
